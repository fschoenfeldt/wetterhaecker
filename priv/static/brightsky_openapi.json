{"openapi":"3.1.0","info":{"title":"Bright Sky","description":"Bright Sky is a free and open-source weather API. It aims to provide an easy-to-use gateway to weather data that the [DWD](https://www.dwd.de/) – Germany's meteorological service – publishes on their [open data server](https://opendata.dwd.de/).\n\nThe public instance at `https://api.brightsky.dev/` is free-to-use for all purposes, **no API key required**! Please note that the [DWD's Terms of Use](https://www.dwd.de/EN/service/copyright/copyright_artikel.html) apply to all data you retrieve through the API.\n\n> This documentation is generated from an OpenAPI specification. The current version is available from https://api.brightsky.dev/openapi.json.\n\n\n## Quickstart\n\n* Check out [`/current_weather`](operations/getCurrentWeather) if you want to know what the weather's like _right now_.\n* Check out [`/weather`](operations/getWeather) for hourly weather observations and forecasts.\n* Check out [`/radar`](operations/getRadar) if you're looking for a high-resolution rain radar.\n* Check out [`/alerts`](operations/getAlerts) if you're interested in weather alerts.\n\n... or keep reading below for some background information.\n\n\n## Good to Know\n\n* **Geographical coverage**: due to its nature as German meteorological service, the observations published by the DWD have a strong focus on Germany. The _forecasts_ cover the whole world, albeit at a much lower density outside of Germany.\n* **Historical coverage**: Bright Sky serves historical data going back to January 1st, 2010. If you need data that goes further back, check out our [infrastructure repository](https://github.com/jdemaeyer/brightsky-infrastructure) to easily set up your own instance of Bright Sky!\n* **Source IDs**: Bright Sky's _source IDs_ are a technical artifact and – unlike the [DWD station IDs](https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/klimadatendeutschland/stationsliste.html) and [WMO station IDs](https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/help/stations_list_CLIMAT_data.txt) – have no meaning in the real world. When making requests to Bright Sky, try to avoid them and supply lat/lon or station IDs instead.\n\n\n## Useful Links\n\n* [Bright Sky source code and issue tracking](https://github.com/jdemaeyer/brightsky/)\n* [Bright Sky infrastructure configuration](https://github.com/jdemaeyer/brightsky-infrastructure/)\n* [DWD Open Data landing page](https://www.dwd.de/EN/ourservices/opendata/opendata.html)\n* [Additional explanation files for DWD Open Data](https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/opendata/hilfe.html?nn=495490&lsbId=627548), including:\n    * [List of main observation stations](https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/opendata/help/stationen/ha_messnetz.xls?__blob=publicationFile&v=1)\n    * [List of additional observation stations](https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/opendata/help/stationen/na_messnetz.xlsx?__blob=publicationFile&v=10)\n    * [List of MOSMIX stations](https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/met_verfahren_mosmix/mosmix_stationskatalog.cfg?view=nasPublication&nn=495490)\n    * [List of meteorological parameters](https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/opendata/help/schluessel_datenformate/kml/mosmix_elemente_pdf.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=2)\n* [DWD Open Data FAQ (German)](https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/opendata/faqs_opendata.html)\n* [DWD Copyright information](https://www.dwd.de/EN/service/copyright/copyright_artikel.html)\n\n\n## Data Sources\n\nAll data available through Bright Sky is taken or derived from data on the [DWD open data server](https://opendata.dwd.de/):\n\n* **Current weather / SYNOP**:\n  * https://opendata.dwd.de/weather/weather_reports/synoptic/germany/json/\n* **Hourly weather**:\n  * Historical: https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/observations_germany/climate/\n  * Current day: https://opendata.dwd.de/weather/weather_reports/poi/\n  * Forecasts: https://opendata.dwd.de/weather/local_forecasts/mos/\n* **Radar**:\n  * https://opendata.dwd.de/weather/radar/composite/rv/\n* **Alerts**:\n  * https://opendata.dwd.de/weather/alerts/cap/COMMUNEUNION_DWD_STAT/\n","contact":{"name":"Jakob de Maeyer","url":"https://brightsky.dev/","email":"jakob@brightsky.dev"},"license":{"name":"MIT License","identifier":"MIT"},"version":"2.2.6"},"servers":[{"url":"https://api.brightsky.dev"}],"paths":{"/sources":{"get":{"tags":["Internals"],"summary":"Weather sources (stations)","description":"Return a list of all Bright Sky sources matching the given location\ncriteria, ordered by distance.\n\nYou must supply both `lat` and `lon` _or_ one of `dwd_station_id`,\n`wmo_station_id`, or `source_id`.","operationId":"getSources","parameters":[{"name":"lat","in":"query","required":false,"schema":{"type":"number","maximum":90,"minimum":-90,"description":"Latitude in decimal degrees.","examples":[52.52,51.55],"title":"Lat"},"description":"Latitude in decimal degrees."},{"name":"lon","in":"query","required":false,"schema":{"type":"number","maximum":180,"minimum":-180,"description":"Longitude in decimal degrees.","examples":[13.4,9.9],"title":"Lon"},"description":"Longitude in decimal degrees."},{"name":"max_dist","in":"query","required":false,"schema":{"type":"integer","maximum":500000,"minimum":0,"description":"Maximum distance of record location from the location given by `lat` and `lon`, in meters.

Use the default\n`compressed` format if possible – this'll get you the fastest response\ntimes by far and reduce load on the server. If you have a small-ish\nbounding box (e.g. 250 x 250 pixels), using the `plain` format should be\nfine.\n\n### Quickstart\n\nThis request will get you radar data near Münster, reaching 200 km to the\nEast/West/North/South, as a two-dimensional grid of integers:\n\n[`https://api.brightsky.dev/radar?lat=52&lon=7.6&format=plain`](https://api.brightsky.dev/radar?lat=52&lon=7.6&format=plain)\n\n### Content\n\n* The grid is a polar stereographic projection of Germany and the regions\n  bordering it. This is different from the mercator projection used for\n  most consumer-facing maps like OpenStreetMap or Google Maps, and\n  overlaying the radar data onto such a map without conversion\n  (reprojection) will be inaccurate! Check out our [radar\n  demo](https://brightsky.dev/demo/radar/) for an example of correctly\n  reprojecting the radar data using OpenLayers. Alternatively, take a look\n  at the `dwd:RV-Produkt` layer on the [DWD's open\n  GeoServer](https://maps.dwd.de/geoserver/web/wicket/bookmarkable/org.geoserver.web.demo.MapPreviewPage)\n  for ready-made tiles you can overlay onto a map.\n* The [proj-string](https://proj.org/en/9.2/usage/quickstart.html) for the\n  grid projection is `+proj=stere +lat_0=90 +lat_ts=60 +lon_0=10 +a=6378137\n  +b=6356752.3142451802 +no_defs +x_0=543196.83521776402\n  +y_0=3622588.8619310018`. The radar pixels range from `-500` (left) to\n  `1099500` (right) on the x-axis, and from `500` (top) to `-1199500`\n  (bottom) on the y-axis, each radar pixel a size of `1000x1000` (1 km²).\n* The DWD data does not cover the whole grid! Many areas near the edges\n  will always be `0`.\n* Values represent 0.01 mm / 5 min. I.e., if a pixel has a value of `45`,\n  then 0.45 mm of precipitation fell in the corresponding square kilometer\n  in the past five minutes.\n* The four corners of the grid are as follows:\n  * Northwest: Latitude `55.86208711`, Longitude `1.463301510`\n  * Northeast: Latitude `55.84543856`, Longitude `18.73161645`\n  * Southeast: Latitude `45.68460578`, Longitude `16.58086935`\n  * Southwest: Latitude `45.69642538`, Longitude `3.566994635`\n\nYou can find details and more information in the [DWD's `RV product info`\n(German\nonly)](https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/radarprodukte/formatbeschreibung_rv.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=3).\nBelow is an example visualization of the rainfall radar data taken from\nthis document, using the correct projection and showing the radar coverage:\n\n![image](https://github.com/jdemaeyer/brightsky/assets/10531844/09f9bb5f-088a-417e-8a0c-ea5a20fe0969)\n\n### Code examples\n\n> The radar data is quite big (naively unpacking the default 25-frames\n> response into Python integer arrays will eat roughly 125 MB of memory),\n> so use `bbox` whenever you can.\n\n#### `compressed` format\n\nWith Javascript using [`pako`](https://github.com/nodeca/pako):\n\n```js\nfetch(\n  'https://api.brightsky.dev/radar'\n).then((resp) => resp.json()\n).then((respData) => {\n  const raw = respData.radar[0].precipitation_5;\n  const compressed = Uint8Array.from(atob(raw), c => c.charCodeAt(0));\n  const rawBytes = pako.inflate(compressed).buffer;\n  const precipitation = new Uint16Array(rawBytes);\n});\n```\n\nWith Python using `numpy`:\n\n```python\nimport base64\nimport zlib\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport requests\n\nresp = requests.get('https://api.brightsky.dev/radar')\nraw = resp.json()['radar'][0]['precipitation_5']\nraw_bytes = zlib.decompress(base64.b64decode(raw))\n\ndata = np.frombuffer(\n    raw_bytes,\n    dtype='i2',\n).reshape(\n    # Adjust `1200` and `1100` to the height/width of your bbox\n    (1200, 1100),\n)\n```\n\nWith Python using the standard library's `array`:\n```python\nimport array\n\n# [... load raw_bytes as above ...]\n\ndata = array.array('H')\ndata.frombytes(raw_bytes)\ndata = [\n    # Adjust `1200` and `1100` to the height/width of your bbox\n    data[row*1100:(row+1)*1100]\n    for row in range(1200)\n]\n```\n\nSimple plot using `matplotlib`:\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# [... load data as above ...]\n\nplt.imshow(data, vmax=50)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n#### `bytes` format\n\nSame as for `compressed`, but add `?format=bytes` to the URL and remove the\ncall to `zlib.decompress`, using just `raw_bytes = base64.b64decode(raw)`\ninstead.\n\n#### `plain` format\n\nThis is obviously a lot simpler than the `compressed` format. It is,\nhowever, also a lot slower. Nonetheless, if you have a small-ish `bbox` the\nperformance difference becomes manageable, so just using the `plain` format\nand not having to deal with unpacking logic can be a good option in this\ncase.\n\nWith Python:\n```python\nimport requests\n\nresp = requests.get('https://api.brightsky.dev/radar?format=plain')\ndata = resp.json()['radar'][0]['precipitation_5']\n```\n\n### Additional resources\n\n* [Source for our radar demo, including reprojecton via OpenLayers](https://github.com/jdemaeyer/brightsky/blob/master/docs/demo/radar/index.html)\n* [Raw data on the Open Data Server](https://opendata.dwd.de/weather/radar/composite/rv/)\n* [Details on the `RV` product (German)](https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/radarprodukte/formatbeschreibung_rv.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=3)\n* [Visualization of current rainfall radar](https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/radarbild_film/radarbild_film.html)\n* [General info on DWD radar products (German)](https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/radarprodukte/radarprodukte.html)\n* [Radar status (German)](https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/radarniederschlag/rn_info/home_freie_radarstatus_kartendaten.html?nn=16102)\n* [DWD notifications for radar products (German)](https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/radolan/radolan_info/radolan_informationen.html?nn=16102)","operationId":"getRadar","parameters":[{"name":"bbox","in":"query","required":false,"schema":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"integer"},"description":"Bounding box (top, left, bottom, right) **in pixels**, edges are inclusive.
